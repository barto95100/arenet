# Alerting

**🌐 English** · [Français](Alerting-FR)

Step AL — Arenet's native alerting subsystem. Configure **rules** that watch a **source** (e.g. WAF event rate, cert expiry, cert renewal failures, system health) ; when the rule's evaluator trips, an alert is dispatched to one or more **channels** (Discord webhook, generic webhook, SMTP email).

A 30-second polling watcher evaluates every rule and respects per-rule cooldowns to prevent alert storms.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Wire a channel

1. Sidebar → **Alerting** → **Channels** tab → **+ Add channel**
2. Pick the kind : **`webhook`**, **`email`** or **`discord`**.

   > This page previously named them `discord_webhook`, `webhook_generic`
   > and `email_smtp`, and described fields that never existed. It was
   > written from a design note and never reconciled with the code;
   > corrected in v2.53 against the implementation.

3. Fill in the kind-specific config :

**Discord** (since v2.53) :
- Webhook URL : `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>` — in Discord, *Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → Copy Webhook URL*. Must be https on `discord.com` or `discordapp.com`; anything else is refused while you are still looking at the form.
- Display name (optional) : overrides the name Discord shows
- Mention users / Mention roles (optional, since v2.54) : Discord **IDs**, separated by commas or spaces. In Discord, turn on *Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode*, then right-click a member or a role and *Copy ID*. A pseudo does not work here and Arenet refuses it: Discord only resolves numeric IDs, so `@someone` typed as text would post as plain text and notify nobody.
- Timeout : 1-60 s, default 10

**How mentions behave.** Discord raises a notification only for a mention in a message's *content*, never for one inside an embed. Arenet's alert is an embed, so the mentions are posted as a short line above it — that line is the only thing Arenet ever puts in `content`. Everyone listed is pinged on **every** alert this channel sends.

Arenet also sends an allow-list naming exactly the IDs you configured. A consequence worth knowing: an alert whose text happens to contain `@everyone` cannot ping your server.

That is all. Arenet builds the Discord payload itself — there is no body template to write, which is the whole reason this kind exists (see *Discord before v2.53* below).

**The URL is the credential.** Anyone holding it can post to your channel, so Arenet stores it as a secret, shows it redacted afterwards, and keeps the stored one if you edit the channel without retyping it.

**Generic webhook** :
- URL : your endpoint. Also treated as a secret, for the same reason.
- Method : `POST` only
- Headers : key-value list (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer xxx`); values are redacted in the audit trail, keys are not
- Body template : optional Go template. **Empty sends the whole alert event as JSON** — not a reduced envelope.

  If you write one and it produces JSON, wrap every value in `json` so quotes and newlines cannot break it:

  ```
  {"text": {{ json .Subject }}}
  ```

  `json` emits the surrounding quotes, so do not add your own. Available fields: `.RuleName`, `.Severity`, `.Subject`, `.Body`, `.Category`, `.Timestamp`, `.RuleID`, `.ID`.

**Email** :
- SMTP host + port (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com:587`)
- Username + password (an app password if 2FA is on)
- From + To addresses
- TLS : implicit TLS (typically port 465) or STARTTLS (typically 587)

4. **Enabled** ✅
5. **Test channel** button : fires a synthetic alert through the channel to validate the wiring. Watch for the test message in Discord / inbox.
6. **Save**

### 2. Wire a rule

1. Sidebar → **Alerting** → **Rules** tab → **+ Add rule**
2. **Name** : kebab-case slug, e.g. `cert-failed-vault`
3. **Severity** : 1 (low) → 5 (critical)
4. **Source** : pick from the dropdown :
   - `waf_event_rate` — count WAF events over a window
   - `cert_expiry` — days-until-NotAfter for a domain (or earliest)
   - `cert_renewal_failed` — count cert_failed events over a window
   - `system_health` — current health status of an Arenet subsystem
5. **Source params** : kind-specific (per-source fields appear)
6. **Eval kind** :
   - `threshold` : numeric comparison (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) + value
   - `state` : exact match on a string value (used with `system_health`)
7. **Channels** : multi-select from your wired channels
8. **Cooldown** : seconds between successive alerts for this rule (default 300s = 5min)
9. **Subject template** (optional) + **Body template** (optional) : Go template strings with access to `{{.RuleName}}`, `{{.Value}}`, `{{.Labels}}`, `{{.Context}}` (see *Templates* below)
10. **Test rule** button : evaluates the rule once with the current source value, optionally dispatches if it would trip
11. **Save**

The watcher picks up the new rule within 30s and starts evaluating.

## Available sources

### `waf_event_rate`

Counts `waf_event` rows in a sliding window. Use to alert on attack volume spikes.

Params :
- `routeId` (optional) : limit to one route ; empty = all routes
- `category` (optional) : limit to one OWASP category (e.g. `SQLi`, `attack-protocol`)
- `action` (optional) : `BLOCK` / `DETECT` / `""`
- `windowSecs` : `60`-`86400`, default `300` (5min)

Returns count as Float.

Example rule : "Alert when > 50 WAF events in 5 minutes on any route" → threshold `>` `50`.

### `cert_expiry`

Returns days until NotAfter for a cert.

Params :
- `host` (optional) : the cert's primary subject ; empty = the earliest-expiring cert across all tracked certs

Returns days remaining as Float (negative = already expired).

Example rules :
- "Warn 30d before expiry" : threshold `<` `30`, severity 2
- "Critical 7d before expiry" : threshold `<` `7`, severity 4
- "Alert on expired" : threshold `<` `0`, severity 5

Wire all three with different channels (e.g. severity 4+5 also goes to email) for tiered escalation.

### `cert_renewal_failed`

Counts `cert_event` rows of type `cert_failed` in a sliding window. Use to alert on ACME renewal failures.

Params :
- `domain` (optional) : limit to one domain ; empty = all
- `windowSecs` : `60`-`604800`, default `86400` (24h ; matches Let's Encrypt retry cadence)

Returns count as Float. Typical threshold : `>` `0` (any failure).

### `system_health`

Returns the current health status of Arenet subsystems.

Params :
- `component` (optional) : `crowdsec_agent`, `dns_provider_ovh`, `caddy`, ... ; empty = global aggregated status

Returns string : `healthy` / `degraded` / `down`. Use with `state` eval kind :

```
eval: state
expected: "degraded"
```

Trips when the component goes from healthy to degraded.

---

## Eval kinds

### Threshold (numeric)

```
operator: > / < / >= / <= / == / !=
value: <number>
```

The source's returned Float is compared. Trips on true.

### State (string)

```
expected: <string>
```

The source's returned String is compared by exact equality. Trips on match.

State eval is used for `system_health` ; future sources may add more.

---

## Cooldown behaviour

Each rule has a `cooldownSecs` (default 300s). After an alert fires, the rule is muted for that duration even if the condition stays trip.

The watcher tracks last-fire timestamps per-rule in BoltDB (`alert_rules_eval_state` bucket). Cooldowns survive Arenet restarts.

Pick cooldowns matched to the scenario :
- **Cert expiry** : `86400` (24h) — once a day until you fix it
- **WAF event rate spike** : `1800` (30min) — frequent enough to notice trend, not pager-noisy
- **System health degraded** : `300` (5min) — quick re-notification when status changes

---

## Templates

Subject + body templates use Go's `text/template` with this context (the fields the watcher passes at fire time) :

```
.RuleName    — the rule's name (snapshot at fire time, so a later rename doesn't relabel old alerts)
.RuleID      — the rule's ID
.Severity    — severity word (info / warning / error / critical)
.Category    — the rule's category (waf / crowdsec / cert / system …)
.Source      — the source name (e.g. waf_event_rate, cert_expiry)
.Timestamp   — time.Time of the evaluation ({{.Timestamp.Format "2006-01-02 15:04 MST"}})
.Value       — the source's return value: the number for threshold rules, the string for state rules
.Labels      — string→string map the source attached (e.g. {{.Labels.route_id}}, {{.Labels.window_secs}})
.Context     — structured payload some sources attach (free-form; see the WAF breakdown below)
```

Default subject : `[{{.Severity}}] {{.RuleName}} fired`
Default body : `Rule {{.RuleName}} fired. Source {{.Source}} value: {{.Value}}`

A missing field renders empty (templates compile with `missingkey=zero`), so a typo degrades gracefully instead of failing the send.

### WAF event-rate breakdown

A `waf_event_rate` alert attaches a breakdown to `.Context` so the mail can **name the offenders**, not only count them. Each list is an exact top-5 over the same window/filter as the count, and is present only when there was at least one event :

```
.Context.topIPs    — busiest source IPs
.Context.topRules  — most-fired CRS rule IDs
.Context.topPaths  — most-targeted request paths
```

Each entry has `.Key` (the IP / rule ID / path) and `.Count` (number of events). Example body :

```
WAF events in the last 5 minutes: {{.Value}}

Top source IPs:
{{range .Context.topIPs}}  - {{.Key}} ({{.Count}}x)
{{end}}
Top CRS rules:
{{range .Context.topRules}}  - {{.Key}} ({{.Count}}x)
{{end}}
Top paths:
{{range .Context.topPaths}}  - {{.Key}} ({{.Count}}x)
{{end}}
Rule: {{.RuleName}} | Source: {{.Source}}
```

## Webhook URL and secrets

A webhook URL is itself a credential (a Discord or Slack URL contains the token), so `GET` returns it masked (`https://host/[redacted]`), as it does for header values. Saving a channel without retyping them keeps the stored values — Arenet restores them.

**Before v2.39** that restore was missing for the URL: editing a webhook channel without retyping the URL saved the masked value, and the channel stopped sending silently. Such a channel is now flagged when you open it ("the webhook URL was lost…"), with an empty URL field: retype the URL and save to repair it.

---

## Alert history

Sidebar → **Alerting** → **History** tab — chronological list of every alert fired, with rule name, severity, source value at fire-time, channels notified, and delivery status (success per channel).

Filter by rule / severity / channel / time range.

Useful for :
- Confirming a Discord channel really received the alert (`delivery_status=ok`)
- Post-mortem : "what alerts did the cert outage trigger ?"
- Cooldown debugging : if a rule fires once then nothing, check the cooldown timestamp

---

## Test mode

Every channel + every rule has a **Test** button. Channels send a synthetic envelope ("This is an Arenet test alert..."), rules evaluate the current source value and optionally dispatch.

Use after every config change to validate end-to-end without waiting for a real condition to trip.

## Common patterns

### Cert expiry tiered alerts

| Rule | Source | Threshold | Severity | Channels |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| `cert-expiry-30d` | `cert_expiry` | `<` `30` | 2 | Discord |
| `cert-expiry-7d` | `cert_expiry` | `<` `7` | 4 | Discord + Email |
| `cert-expiry-1d` | `cert_expiry` | `<` `1` | 5 | Discord + Email + Webhook (to your phone) |

### WAF attack volume

| Rule | Source | Window | Threshold |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| `waf-spike-5min` | `waf_event_rate` (all routes) | 300s | `>` `100` |
| `waf-spike-blocked` | `waf_event_rate` (action=BLOCK) | 300s | `>` `10` |

The second rule is the genuinely alarming one (block-mode actively rejecting).

### Cert ACME failures

| Rule | Source | Window | Threshold |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| `cert-renewal-fail-24h` | `cert_renewal_failed` (all domains) | 86400s | `>` `0` |

Combined with `cert-expiry-7d`, you have full coverage : the alert fires immediately on the renewal attempt failure AND again 7 days before expiry if nothing was done.

### System health

| Rule | Source | Eval | Cooldown |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | -------- |
| `crowdsec-down` | `system_health` (component=crowdsec_agent) | state == "degraded" | 300s |
| `dns-provider-down` | `system_health` (component=dns_provider_ovh) | state == "degraded" | 300s |
