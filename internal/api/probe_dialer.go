// v2.56 — where a diagnostic probe may not go.
//
// Arenet's admin API has two endpoints that fetch a URL on the operator's
// behalf: the upstream Test button, and the health-check Test button. Both
// take their target from the request, which is correct — the operator is
// testing an address they are about to save — and it makes the admin API a
// way to reach anything the Arenet host can reach.
//
// A homelab reverse proxy must keep reaching private space: 10/8, 172.16/12,
// 192.168/16 and loopback are where the upstreams actually are. What it has
// no business fetching is the link-local range, because that is where cloud
// instance metadata lives (169.254.169.254 on every major provider, and
// fd00:ec2::254 on AWS over IPv6). Those endpoints hand out instance
// credentials to whoever asks from the instance.
//
// The check runs AFTER name resolution, on the IP actually being dialled,
// and it runs per connection attempt. A pre-flight lookup would be a
// different thing: the name could resolve to a harmless address for the
// check and to 169.254.169.254 for the connection that follows (DNS
// rebinding), and a name with several A records would only have its first
// one inspected. net.Dialer.Control is called once per candidate address
// with the resolved host:port, which is exactly the right seam — it also
// covers any redirect a probe follows, since each hop dials again.

// The SSRF guard itself — which addresses a server-side fetch may not
// reach, and the dialer that refuses them — lives in internal/netguard,
// so the alerting channel senders share one implementation with these
// probes. The names below are thin aliases kept for the probe call sites
// and the audit classification.

// errBlockedProbeTarget is returned when a probe resolves to an address
// it may not reach. It IS netguard.ErrBlocked, so errors.Is against
// either recognises the refusal.
var errBlockedProbeTarget = netguard.ErrBlocked

// blockedProbeAuditMarker is the substring a humanised probe error keeps
// from the guard, used to tell a refusal apart from an ordinary dial
// failure when choosing the audit action. netguard.ErrBlocked's message
// ("target is not allowed") carries it.
const blockedProbeAuditMarker = "not allowed"

// probeTargetBlocked reports whether an IP is one a diagnostic probe must
// not connect to, and why. Delegates to the shared guard: private ranges
// and loopback are deliberately allowed (a homelab upstream IS private);
// link-local / cloud-metadata is refused.
func probeTargetBlocked(ip net.IP) (bool, string) { return netguard.Blocked(ip) }

// newProbeDialer returns a dialer that refuses the addresses above,
// checked after resolution per candidate address.
func newProbeDialer(timeout time.Duration) *net.Dialer { return netguard.NewDialer(timeout) }

// probeAuditAction picks the audit action for a finished probe: the
// refusal gets its own, so an attempt at a blocked address is searchable
// rather than buried among ordinary failures.

	if strings.Contains(probeErr, blockedProbeAuditMarker) {
		return audit.ActionProbeRefused
	}

// probeAuditTarget fills the event's structured target.
//
// v2.56.2 — the probe rows carried their target in the free-text message
// only, so the audit table's Target column was empty and nothing could be
// filtered or joined on. TargetType is free-form (the store validates
// nothing), and values like "access_log" already exist, so "upstream" is
// the honest name for what was probed.
//
// The route is recorded alongside rather than instead: the address is what
// was contacted and belongs in the column, while the route it was launched
// from is context and belongs in the structured detail. A probe from the
// create form has no route yet, and the field is simply absent.
