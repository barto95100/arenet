// Precedence (mirrors the Critique 11 Pack A spec and the
// Topology C13 gate contract). The key invariant: the unhealthy
// signal is ALWAYS strong enough to suppress green, even when
// some upstreams are still in the warm-up window. We never claim
// "healthy" while any unhealthy upstream is recorded.
//
//   1. Route has no HealthCheck configured           → "unknown"
//      (the C13 gate: don't paint green or red on an upstream
//      the operator chose not to monitor, regardless of any
//      stale state the tracker might be carrying.)
//   2. No upstreams (defensive — storage validation forbids it)  → "unknown"
//   3. unhealthyCount == total AND no warm-up        → "down"
//      (every upstream observed AND every one unhealthy.)
//   4. unhealthyCount > 0                            → "degraded"
//      (any unhealthy signal degrades the route, whether or not
//      other upstreams are healthy or still warming up.)
//   5. healthyCount == total                         → "healthy"
//      (full confidence — every upstream observed AND healthy.)
//   6. Otherwise — partial coverage with no unhealthy signal
//      yet (warm-up window)                          → "unknown"
//
// Returns (status, healthyCount, totalCount). Counts always
// reflect the actual upstream pool sizes regardless of HC config,
// so the frontend can render "N/M sains" with consistent
// denominators even on unmonitored routes (where N is always 0).
//
// `status` may be nil — callers must tolerate that to keep the
// pre-Pack-A no-tracker-installed code path identical to "no HC
// configured" (collapses to unknown).
