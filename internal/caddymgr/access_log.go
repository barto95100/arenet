// v2.50 — the HTTP access log, emitted so CrowdSec can parse it.
//
// Arenet used to emit no access log at all: no `logs` on any server, no
// `logging` block. An agent installed beside it therefore enforced the
// community blocklist and detected nothing about this host, with nothing
// saying so. See
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-access-log-for-crowdsec-design.md.
//
// The format is Caddy's stock JSON, deliberately unmodified: the
// crowdsecurity/caddy collection already parses it, reading
// request.client_ip, status, request.uri, request.method,
// request.headers, request.host and resp_headers. Inventing an
// Arenet-shaped log would mean shipping and maintaining a parser too.

	// wrapLogger then .Named(<default_logger_name>) per request

//
//   - it matches parameter names through a url.Values map lookup (:418),
//     so it is case-SENSITIVE: `?Access_Token=` would slip past;
//   - it rebuilds the query with q.Encode() (:432), which re-orders the
//     parameters alphabetically and re-encodes them, so a line no longer
//     shows the URI the client actually sent.
//
// One case-insensitive regexp does the whole list in a single pass,
// touches only the matched values, and leaves order and encoding alone.
// RegexpFilter applies it with ReplaceAllString (:623), so ${1} carries
// the `name=` prefix through.
