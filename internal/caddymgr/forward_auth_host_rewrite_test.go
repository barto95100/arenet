// v2.58.1 — the forward-auth sub-request and the IdP passthrough route both
// go to the verify host, so they must agree about the Host header.
//
// They did not. buildForwardAuthHandler honoured RewriteVerifyHost and
// buildAuthPassthroughRoute ignored it, so an IdP behind a third-party
// reverse proxy that routes by Host — Authentik behind Traefik, the common
// deployment — had a working auth check and a broken sign-in round trip:
// every browser request to the IdP's own endpoint got that proxy's 404.
//
// Found while helping an operator wire exactly that topology. Arenet is not
// only for the case where it reaches the IdP directly, so both have to work
// from one setting.
