// pathMatchers returns Caddy path matchers for a prefix: the prefix
// itself + everything under it. "/docs" → ["/docs","/docs/*"].
//
// The trailing slash is stripped first, and that is load-bearing
// (v2.73). Concatenating "/*" onto a prefix that already ended in "/"
// produced "/admin//*", and Caddy disables slash merging for any
// pattern containing "//" (v2.11.4 caddyhttp/matchers.go:475), then
// prefix-matches against the literal "/admin//" — which no ordinary
// request produces. So a rule on "/admin/" matched "/admin/" and
// NOTHING ELSE: every path under it fell through to
// buildPathRulesSubroute's match-less catch-all and was proxied with
// the rule's basic auth, forward auth, IP filter and rate limit never
// executed. The exact path still prompted, so the gate tested as
// working. A prefix of "/" was worse still: ["/", "//*"] gated the
// root and not one path beneath it.
//
// Two places in this codebase already had it right and disagreed with
// this one: storage's own matches() helper trims the slash
// (internal/storage/routes.go:410), and buildAuthPassthroughRoute
// normalises the same way (manager.go:3985).

// buildPathRulesSubroute wraps the proxy in a subroute whose inner
// routes are the path-rules (sorted longest-prefix first, Q4) each
// applying its override handlers (path IP filter block, then basic
// auth) before proxying, followed by a match-less catch-all proxy.
//
// Ordering inside a matched path route is IP filter BEFORE basic
// auth BEFORE proxy: a blocked client gets its 403 without ever
// reaching the auth prompt (avoids leaking that the path exists /
// wasting a credential round-trip on traffic that would be denied
// anyway).
//
// The catch-all (no `match`) is REQUIRED: without it, a request
// whose path doesn't fall under any PathRule prefix would have no
// route to fall through to inside this subroute and would be
// dropped instead of reaching the plain proxy.
//
// Per-path upstream (v2.23.0): the TERMINAL proxy of each matched
// path route is resolved by pathProxyBuilder(pr), not by the shared
// routeProxy. A rule with its own upstream pool proxies to THAT pool
// (own load-balancing / health-check / transport, sharing the route's
// error-branding handle_response — supplied by the caller's closure);
// a rule with no pool returns the routeProxy verbatim (inherit). The
// catch-all still appends routeProxy, so any path outside every rule
// prefix reaches the route's own pool. pathProxyBuilder may fail (a
// malformed per-path upstream URL) — the error is propagated so the
// whole config build fails closed rather than emitting a half-built
// subroute.
//
// Ordering is UNCHANGED — [IP-block?] → [basic-auth?] → [proxy] — so
// a fail-closed IP filter still gates BEFORE the path's own upstream:
// a blocked client gets its 403 without the request ever reaching the
// per-path pool.
