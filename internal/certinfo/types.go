// Package certinfo bridges certmagic's per-cert runtime state into
// AreNET's API surface. T.1 of Step T (spec at docs/superpowers/
// specs/2026-06-04-step-t-certificates-runtime-refactor.md, frozen
// at v1.2.0-step-t-spec, commit 9a34eb1).
//
// Architecture (§1.7 of the spec, locked):
//
//  1. Subscribe to certmagic events through the Caddy events App
//     via an events.handlers.arenet_cert_info module (same shape
//     as internal/caddyhc — see commits 1926f78 + 3b371d8 for the
//     template).
//  2. Maintain an in-memory CertRuntimeInfo cache keyed on
//     certificate primary domain.
//  3. Reconcile from certmagic's on-disk storage at boot so certs
//     obtained BEFORE the events listener registered are still
//     visible immediately.
//
// Forward-compat seam for Step T+1 (ACME events log): the tracker
// exposes Subscribe(handler EventHandler) so a future package can
// fan out on the same events without modifying T's runtime cache.
// AC #18 pins this contract.
//
// EMPIRICAL EVENT NAMES (verified during T.1 recon against
// certmagic v0.25.3 — DO NOT trust inferred names):
//
//   - cert_obtaining (config.go:605, :891) — about to attempt issuance.
//     Payload: {identifier}.
//   - cert_obtained  (config.go:728, :1019) — issuance succeeded.
//     Payload: {renewal bool, identifier, issuer, storage_path,
//     private_key_path, certificate_path, metadata_path, csr_pem}.
//     RENEWAL is detected via renewal=true (no separate
//     "cert_renewed" event exists in v0.25.3).
//   - cert_failed    (config.go:693, :983) — issuance failed.
//     Payload: {renewal bool, identifier, [remaining], issuers,
//     error}.
//   - cached_managed_cert / cached_unmanaged_cert (certificates.go:
//     261, 322, 358, 376, 407) — emitted when a cert is loaded into
//     certmagic's in-memory cache. Payload: {sans, [replacement]}.
//     Used by T.1's reconcile-vs-live diff path to know which certs
//     are actually loaded right now.
//
// EMPIRICAL EVENT ORIGIN (verified against caddyserver/caddy v2.11.3,
// modules/caddytls/tls.go:1001-1004):
//
//	The certmagic emit callback flows through (*caddytls.TLS).onEvent
//	which calls t.events.Emit(t.ctx, eventName, data). The originating
//	Caddy module ID is therefore "tls" (the top-level TLS app, declared
//	at modules/caddytls/tls.go:156), NOT "tls.issuance.acme" or any
//	sub-namespace. The Caddy events App's dispatch loop walks UP the
//	module tree from the origin (caddyevents/app.go:269-313), so the
//	subscription filter MUST select "tls" or a strict ancestor (the
//	empty string for "all events"); a more specific filter would
//	never match. Same shape of trap as Stage B's
//	"http.handlers.reverse_proxy.health_checker" mistake (Bug 1, fixed
//	in commit 3b371d8). The empirical recon paid off — no wrong-filter
//	first-deploy here.
