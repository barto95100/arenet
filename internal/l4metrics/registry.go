// Package l4metrics counts what a layer-4 relay carries.
//
// v2.42 — without this, a TCP or UDP service is a part of the
// installation nobody can watch: its traffic never crosses the HTTP
// chain, so the dashboard, the logs and the per-route counters see
// nothing of it. An operator would configure a database relay and
// have no way to know whether anyone ever connected.
//
// The shape is deliberately not the HTTP one. There are no status
// codes and no request latency at layer 4; what an operator asks is
// how many connections came, how many are open right now, how much
// went each way, and how many failed to reach the backend.
//
// Counters are cumulative since the process started, plus a live
// gauge for open connections. The registry is process-wide and
// installed once at boot, exactly like internal/metrics.
