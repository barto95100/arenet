// Registry holds per-route request and 5xx-error counters with
// concurrency semantics specified in §4 of the Step E spec:
//
//   - Inc is the hot path: RLock + atomic add. Called once per
//     proxied HTTP request, must not allocate (bench < 200 ns
//     per op, allocs/op == 0).
//   - Snapshot runs at 1 Hz from the Ticker goroutine: RLock +
//     atomic.SwapUint64 per cell, returns a fresh map of Deltas
//     (count since previous tick, NOT cumulative — spec §11.9).
//   - Sync runs on each Caddy reload (rare): Lock, then inserts
//     new cells and deletes stale ones in a single critical
//     section regardless of the diff size (spec §4.1).
//
// The Read/Write mutex pattern lets Inc and Snapshot proceed in
// parallel; Sync is the only writer. Inc and Snapshot are correct
// concurrently because each cell field is mutated with atomic
// operations independently of the lock. The lock only protects the
// map's structure (key add/remove), not the cell contents.
//
// The pair (reqs, errs) is NOT atomic together; spec §11.8 documents
// the rare race and the client-side mitigation (errRate clamp).

	//
	// Lifecycle:

	//     (same as the route-level cells map). The inner map is

	//   - Inner cells are not individually pruned: a route may
	//     stop receiving traffic for one of its aliases without
	//     the operator removing the alias. The host-set is bounded
	//     by storage.Route.Aliases length (max ~tens per route on
