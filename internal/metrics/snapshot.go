// Delta is the per-route counter difference produced by one Snapshot
// call. Reqs and Errs are counts SINCE THE PREVIOUS TICK, not
// cumulative totals (spec §11.9). Errs counts 5xx responses
// (kept under that name for Step E wire-shape backward compat —
// the WebSocket clients read .Errs as the 5xx counter).
//
// Step L additions (additive, no Step E regression):
//   - Errs4xx tracks 4xx separately from 5xx (Step L spec §1.3 D1:
//     internet-exposed proxies need 4xx as a security/exposure
//     signal, not folded into "errors").
//   - LatencyP95Ms is the p95 over the per-route latency
//     histogram during the tick window. Zero when no samples
//     landed in this tick — the L.2 API projection layer maps
//     that to JSON null per AC #5 (a "0 ms p95" would render as
//     a fake latency dip on the timeline chart).
//
// Errs may transiently exceed Reqs for a single tick due to the
// non-paired-atomic swap in Registry.Snapshot (spec §11.8). The
// WebSocket wire layer is responsible for clamping errRate5xx to
// [0, 1] before sending; consumers of Delta directly must apply the
// same clamp if they compute a rate.

// JSON marshaler to emit RFC 3339 with the 'Z' suffix the wire
// contract expects; a non-UTC value would render as "+02:00" etc.
