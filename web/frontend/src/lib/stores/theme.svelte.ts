// Theme store (Step F §4). Singleton class instance pattern,
// consistent with auth.svelte.ts and topology.svelte.ts.
//
// `current` mirrors the `<html data-theme>` attribute. The bootstrap
// script in app.html (§4.3) sets the attribute before the first
// paint to avoid FOUC; this store takes over once the app boots.
//
// Sub-task 1.5 wires the server round-trip via authApi.setTheme:
//   - applyLocally optimistically + persist to localStorage
//   - await POST /auth/me/theme
//   - on failure, revert applyLocally and surface a toast
// The Phase 2 reconciliation step (§4.3, last paragraph) compares
// the server's value to whatever the bootstrap picked and adjusts
// silently if they differ (e.g., user changed theme on another
// device since the cookie was last refreshed).
