// Phase Z.5.3 — /logs SOURCE IP cell formatter.
//
// Combines the raw IP with a backend-resolved country code
// (POST /api/v1/geo/lookup-batch) to produce the operator-
// facing label seen in the SOURCE IP column :
//
//   "82.65.x.x · FR"   public IP, MMDB hit
//   "192.168.1.x · LAN" RFC1918 (LAN sentinel)
//   "203.0.113.x · ?"   public IP, MMDB miss / degraded
//   "82.65.x.x"         country lookup not yet resolved (no suffix yet)
//
// IP masking : the last octet (or last 2 IPv6 groups) is
// elided to keep the SOURCE IP column compact AND so casual
// shoulder-surfing of an operator's screen doesn't expose
// full source IPs. Forensic ops still see the full IP in
// the row's title tooltip — that's a separate decision the
// operator owns.

 * Resolve a raw IP + optional country code to its visible
 * label. `country` is the value returned by the lookup-
 * batch endpoint (empty string when the backend didn't
 * find a record or the lookup is degraded ; "LAN" for
 * RFC1918 / loopback / link-local).
 *
 * `country === undefined` means the frontend hasn't called
 * the lookup yet — the IP renders without a suffix so the
 * row appears immediately and the country materializes on
 * the next poll cycle.
